=head1 NAME

Test::Apocalypse - Apocalypse's favorite tests bundled into a simple interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	use strict; use warnings;

	use Test::More;
	eval "use Test::Apocalypse";
	if ( $@ ) {
		plan skip_all => 'Test::Apocalypse required for validating the distribution';
	} else {
		# lousy hack for kwalitee
		require Test::NoWarnings; require Test::Pod; require Test::Pod::Coverage;
		is_apocalypse_here();
	}

=head1 ABSTRACT

Using this test module simplifies/bundles common distribution tests favored by the CPAN id APOCAL.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module greatly simplifies common author tests for modules heading towards CPAN. I was sick of copy/pasting
the tons of t/foo.t scripts + managing them in every distro. I thought it would be nice to bundle all of it into
one module and toss it on CPAN :) That way, every time I update this module all of my dists would be magically
updated!

This module respects the RELEASE_TESTING env variable, if it is not set it will skip the entire testsuite. Normally
end-users should not run it; but you can if you want to see how bad my dists are, ha! The scheme is exactly the same
as the one Alias proposed in L<Test::XT> and in his blog post, L<http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/38822>.

This module uses L<Module::Pluggable> to have custom "backends" that process various tests. We wrap them in a hackish
L<Test::Block> block per-plugin and it seems to work nicely. If you want to write your own, it should be a breeze
once you look at some of my plugins and see how it works. ( more documentation to come )

=head2 Usage

In order to use this, you would need to be familiar with the "standard" steps in order to fully exercise the testsuite.
There are a few steps we require, because our plugins need stuff to be prepared for them. For starters, you would need
a test file in your distribution similar to the one in SYNOPSIS. Once that is done and added to your MANIFEST and etc,
you can do this:

	perl Build.PL			# sets up the dist ( duh, hah )
	./Build dist			# makes the tarball ( so certain plugins can process it )
	RELEASE_TESTING=1 ./Build test	# runs the testsuite!

=head1 Methods

=head2 is_apocalypse_here()

This is the main entry point for this testsuite. By default, it runs every plugin in the testsuite. You can enable/disable
specific plugins if you desire. It accepts a single argument: a hashref or a hash. It can contain various options, but as of
now it only supports two options. If you try to use allow and deny at the same time, this module will throw an exception.

=head3 allow

Setting "allow" to a string or a precompiled regex will run only the plugins that match the regex. If passed a string, this module
will compile it via C<qr/$str/i>.

	# run only the EOL test and disable all other tests
	is_apocalypse_here( {
		allow	=> qr/^EOL$/,
	} );

	# run all "dist" tests
	is_apocalypse_here( {
		allow	=> 'dist',
	} );

=head3 deny

Setting "deny" to a string or a precompiled regex will not run the plugins that match the regex. If passed a string, this module
will compile it via C<qr/$str/i>.

	# disable Pod_Coverage test and enable all other tests
	is_apocalypse_here( {
		deny	=> qr/^Pod_Coverage$/,
	} );

	# disable all pod tests
	is_apocalypse_here( {
		deny	=> 'pod',
	} );

=head2 plugins()

Since this module uses L<Module::Pluggable> you can use this method on the package to find out what plugins are available. Handy if you need
to know what plugins to skip, for example.

WARNING: We enable the "require" option to L<Module::Pluggable> so that means the plugins returned are objects.

	my @tests = Test::Apocalypse->plugins;

=head1 EXPORT

Automatically exports the "is_apocalypse_here" sub.

=head1 MORE IDEAS

=over 4

=item * Document the way we do plugins so others can add to this testsuite :)

=item * POD standards check

Do we have SYNOPSIS, ABSTRACT, SUPPORT, etc sections? ( PerlCritic can do that! Need to investigate more... )

=item * Help with version updates automatically

This little snippet helps a lot, I was wondering if I could integrate it into the testsuite hah!

	find -name '*.pm' | grep -v /blib/ | xargs sed -i "s/\$VERSION = '[^']\+\?';/\$VERSION = '0.09';/"

=item * Use Test::GreaterVersion to sanity check versions

The problem here is that I've got to learn the CPAN backend to extract the module name from the distro tarball,
and pass it on to the test...

=item * Use Test::PerlTidy to check code style

Br0ken install at this time... ( PerlCritic can do that! Need to investigate more... )

=item * Integrate Test::UniqueTestNames into the testsuite

This would be nice, but I'm not sure if I can actually force this on other tests. Otherwise I'll be just making
sure that the Test::Apocalypse tests is unique, which is worthless to $dist trying to clean itself up...

=item * META.yml checks

We should make sure that the META.yml includes the "repository", "license", and other useful keys!

=item * Other AUTHORs

As always, we should keep up on the "latest" in the perl world and look at other authors for what they are doing.

=item * indirect syntax

We should figure out how to use indirect.pm to detect this deprecated method of coding. There's a L<Perl::Critic> plugin for this, yay!

=item * Test::LatestPrereqs

This looks cool but we need to fiddle with config files? My OutdatedPrereqs test already covers it pretty well...

=item * Test::PPPort

Already implemented as PPPort.pm but it's less invasive than my version, ha!

=item * Test::PureASCII

This rocks, as I don't care about unicode in my perl! ;)

=item * Test::Pod::Content

Maybe this is useful to test my "common" boilerplate POD and make sure they are the "latest", eh?

=item * Test::ModuleReady

This looks like a nice module, but I believe what it does is already covered by the numerous tests in this dist?

=item * Test::MyDeps

This is a crazy test, but would help tremendously in finding regressions in your code!
