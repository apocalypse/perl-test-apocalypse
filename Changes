Revision history for Perl extension Test::Apocalypse

* 0.10

	Added smart AUTOMATED_TESTING logic so we are now behaving in the same way as Alias envisaged
		This means certain tests are disabled when AUTOMATED is set :)
	Minor POD/Build.PL/test output tweaks
	Added META.json to FileChecks test
	Bumped Test::Strict prereq to 0.14 because now it works with Moose!
	Tweaked the module loading logic so we have less duplication now + less bugs, yay!
	Fixed a warning in the OutdatedPrereqs test so we don't cause FAILs with the Test::NoWarnings module :(
	Added Test::NoPlan to the testsuite
	Added debugging of test info, thanks POE::Test::Loops!

* 0.09

	Added the PERL_APOCALYPSE env var to override test selection and test all plugins
	Run the plugins in alphabetical order, which is prettier :)
	Removed the crappy stopwords addition in Pod_Spelling test
	Added Test::JSON::Meta to the testsuite

* 0.08

	Minor POD tweaks
	Added Test::Pod::No404s to the testsuite
	Fixed a warning in the PerlMetrics test so we don't cause FAILs with the Test::NoWarnings module :(

* 0.07

	Fixed a issue with META.yml quoting causing parse failures when using tools that depend on it
	Upgraded Module::Build to 0.3601, had to change prereq from '0.2.2' to '0.002002' to satisfy M::B::Compat :(

* 0.06

	Fixed OutdatedPrereqs test so it doesn't blow up on zero prereqs - thanks Ryan52!

	The Kwalitee test for EXPERIMENTAL/EXTRA metrics is not treated as a failure now
	Oops, Module::Pluggable wasn't listed as a prereq!
	Sorry - added a lot of Perl::Critic extensions so you will not get failed tests because you missed to test an extension!

	Added Test::Module::Used to the testsuite
