Revision history for Test::Apocalypse

{{$NEXT}}

	Tweak how we skip/disable plugins because of the recent subtest change, I broke some stuff :(

1.003	2014-10-25 00:12:08 UTC

	Add Test::Mojibake to the dist
	Add more exclusions to the standard Perl::Critic config
	Add PERL_CRITIC_STRICT env var to skip the bundled Perl::Critic config
	Fix an error in Test::Apocalypse::Script
	Use Test::CPAN::Changes instead of the outdated Test::CheckChanges
	Ripped out the dysfunctional Test::NoWarnings in favor of Test::FailWarnings, thanks DAGOLDEN!
	Ignore the 'perl' dependency when checking deps
	Fix version mismatch error when checking dependencies ( 'v0.0.6' vs '0.0.6' )
	Thanks everyone who sent RT tickets to clean up the FAILs :)
	Finally enabled the Test::Vars plugin as I've switched over to using subtests instead of Test::Block

1.002	2011-04-21 21:49:46 UTC

	Add more default exclusions to the Perl::Critic default .perlcriticrc
	Tweaked the OutdatedPrereqs test *again* so it FAILs if a prereq version is higher than found on CPAN
	Tweaked the Dependencies test so it correctly processes found prereqs that has no version

1.001	2011-03-08 21:37:20 UTC

	Tweaked the OutdatedPrereqs test so it will correctly FAIL if a prereq wasn't found on CPAN

1.000	2011-03-04 23:37:23 UTC

	Converted to Dist::Zilla for the release process!

	Added debugging of test info, thanks POE::Test::Loops!
	Replaced Test::Dependencies with homebrew solution utilizing Perl::PrereqScanner
	Removed Test::Module::Used plugin ( see above )
	Removed the Test::Prereq plugin because it never worked reliably and we already have a plugin for it ( see above )
	Removed the Test::UseAllModules plugin because we have other plugins that do the same thing
	Bumped Test::NoPlan prereq to 0.0.6 so it works properly under Test::Block

	Fixed a bug in Test::Spelling where the file stopwords weren't added right
	Fixed a bug in OutdatedPrereqs where it complained if the CPAN version was older than what was specified

0.10	0000-00-00 00:00:00 UTC

	Added smart AUTOMATED_TESTING logic so we are now behaving in the same way as Alias envisaged
		This means certain tests are disabled when AUTOMATED is set :)
	Minor POD/Build.PL/test output tweaks
	Added META.json to FileChecks test
	Bumped Test::Strict prereq to 0.14 because now it works with Moose!
	Tweaked the module loading logic so we have less duplication now + less bugs, yay!
